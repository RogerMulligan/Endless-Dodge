# Endless-Dodge
A 2D Unity Game whereby the player, a fox, needs to dodge falling saws. 

This game was built on Unity 2D using C#. 

The game is simple. Use the left click on a mouse to move the player left and right, avoiding the falling saw objects. When the player collides the game is over and the players score is retained as the highscore to beat on the next round.
